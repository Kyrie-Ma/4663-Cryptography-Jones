### Compositeness
#### 1. Fermat primality test
#### 2. Miller-Rabin and Solovay-Strassen Primality test
#### 3. Frobenius primality test
##### This is a variation of the Miller-Rabin test. This test is a generalization of the Lucas pseudoprime and takes about three times as long as the Miller-Rabin test to compute. However, the probability of this test returning an accurate result is about seven times better.
### Deterministic
#### 1. AKS primality test
